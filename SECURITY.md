# Security Policy

## 🛡️ **Reporting Security Vulnerabilities**

We take the security of the Autonomous Trading Bot seriously. If you believe you have found a security vulnerability, please report it to us as described below.

### **How to Report**

**Please do NOT report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

Instead, please report them via:
- **Email**: [Create an issue marked as "Security"]
- **Private Message**: Contact repository maintainers directly

Include the following information:
- Type of issue (e.g. buffer overflow, SQL injection, etc.)
- Full paths of source file(s) related to the issue
- Location of the affected source code (tag/branch/commit or direct URL)
- Any special configuration required to reproduce the issue
- Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue
- Proof-of-concept or exploit code (if possible)
- Impact of the issue, including how an attacker might exploit it

### **Response Timeline**

- **Initial Response**: Within 48 hours
- **Status Update**: Within 7 days
- **Resolution**: Varies by complexity and severity

## 🔒 **Security Best Practices**

### **API Keys and Secrets**
- ✅ **Never commit real API keys** to version control
- ✅ **Use environment variables** for all sensitive data
- ✅ **Rotate API keys regularly**
- ✅ **Use paper trading** for development and testing

### **Default Credentials**
The system comes with default credentials for demo purposes:
- **Email**: admin@tradingbot.com
- **Password**: admin123

⚠️ **IMPORTANT**: Change these credentials before any production use!

### **Network Security**
- ✅ System is designed for **localhost only**
- ✅ No external network exposure by default
- ✅ All API communications use HTTPS when possible
- ⚠️ Development setup uses HTTP (not suitable for production)

### **Data Protection**
- ✅ **Paper trading mode** uses virtual money only
- ✅ **No real financial risk** in default configuration
- ✅ **Local database** (SQLite) for development
- ✅ **No sensitive data** stored in plain text

## 🚨 **Known Security Considerations**

### **Development Environment**
This is a **development/educational system** with the following limitations:

| Component | Security Status | Production Recommendation |
|-----------|----------------|---------------------------|
| **Authentication** | Basic Laravel auth | Implement 2FA, stronger passwords |
| **API Security** | Basic validation | Add rate limiting, API keys |
| **Database** | SQLite (local) | Use PostgreSQL/MySQL with encryption |
| **Transport** | HTTP (localhost) | Implement HTTPS with SSL certificates |
| **Session Management** | Laravel default | Configure secure session settings |

### **Trading Security**
- ✅ **Paper trading default**: No real money at risk
- ✅ **Position limits**: Maximum 1% per trade
- ✅ **Stop losses**: 5% automatic limits
- ⚠️ **Live trading**: Requires manual mode switch and additional safeguards

## 🔐 **Secure Configuration**

### **Environment Variables**
```bash
# backend/.env
ALPACA_PAPER_KEY=your_paper_key_here
ALPACA_PAPER_SECRET=your_paper_secret_here
MODE=paper  # NEVER set to 'live' without proper security review
```

### **Recommended Security Hardening**

For production or live trading use:

1. **Change Default Credentials**
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   php artisan tinker
   # Create new admin user with strong password
   ```

2. **Enable HTTPS**
   ```bash
   # Configure SSL certificates
   # Update Laravel .env for HTTPS
   ```

3. **Database Security**
   ```bash
   # Use encrypted database
   # Configure database user permissions
   ```

4. **API Security**
   ```bash
   # Implement rate limiting
   # Add API authentication
   # Configure CORS properly
   ```

5. **System Hardening**
   ```bash
   # Disable debug mode
   # Configure proper logging
   # Set up monitoring
   ```

## 📋 **Security Checklist**

Before any production use:

- [ ] Changed default login credentials
- [ ] Configured HTTPS with valid certificates
- [ ] Set up secure database with encryption
- [ ] Implemented rate limiting on APIs
- [ ] Disabled debug mode
- [ ] Configured secure session management
- [ ] Set up proper logging and monitoring
- [ ] Reviewed and tested backup procedures
- [ ] Implemented proper error handling (no sensitive data exposure)
- [ ] Configured firewall rules
- [ ] Set up intrusion detection
- [ ] Documented incident response procedures

## 🚫 **What NOT to Do**

- ❌ **Never commit API keys** to version control
- ❌ **Never use default credentials** in production
- ❌ **Never expose the system** to public internet without proper security
- ❌ **Never start with live trading** without extensive testing
- ❌ **Never ignore security warnings** or bypass safety features
- ❌ **Never store sensitive data** in plain text
- ❌ **Never skip security updates** for dependencies

## 🆘 **Emergency Procedures**

### **Suspected Breach**
1. **Immediately stop** all trading activity
2. **Disconnect** system from internet
3. **Change all credentials** (Alpaca, admin, database)
4. **Review logs** for suspicious activity
5. **Contact Alpaca** to secure trading account
6. **Document the incident** for analysis

### **API Key Compromise**
1. **Revoke compromised keys** in Alpaca dashboard
2. **Generate new keys** for paper trading
3. **Update system configuration**
4. **Monitor account** for unauthorized activity
5. **Review access logs**

## 📞 **Contact Information**
