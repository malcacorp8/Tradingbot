- Technical indicator analysis (RSI, MACD, moving averages)
- Market swing interpretation for up/down trend detection

### ✅ **Self-Learning & Getting Smarter**
- Reinforcement Learning agents using PPO (Proximal Policy Optimization)
- Per-stock autonomous agents that adapt individually
- Online learning - models update incrementally after each trade
- Performance improves over time through experience and rewards

### ✅ **Full Autonomy**

- Volatility-based rewards and risk assessment
- Simplified options premium calculations

### ✅ **Paper Trading Mode**
- Built-in simulation mode for safe testing
- Toggle between paper and live trading
- All features work in simulation first

### ✅ **Risk Management**
- Automatic stop losses (5% default)
- Position sizing limits (1% capital per trade)
- Volatility penalties in reward calculations
- Portfolio concentration limits

## 🚀 Key Innovations

### 1. **Per-Stock Learning Agents**
Each stock has its own RL agent that learns stock-specific patterns and behaviors, leading to specialized trading strategies.

### 2. **Online Incremental Learning**
Models update after every trade cycle, continuously improving without manual retraining.

### 3. **Multi-Modal Data Integration**
Combines price data, technical indicators, and sentiment analysis for comprehensive market understanding.

### 4. **Real-Time Decision Making**
Sub-minute decision cycles enable rapid response to market changes.

### 5. **Comprehensive Risk Management**
Built-in safeguards prevent catastrophic losses while allowing for learning and growth.

## 🎛️ User Interface Features

### Dashboard
- **Real-time Status**: Connection status, trading activity, current mode
- **Portfolio Overview**: Balance, positions, trade counts, win rates per stock
- **Learning Progress**: Episodes, learning cycles, performance improvement
- **Controls**: Start/stop trading, mode switching, emergency stops

### Configuration
- **Stock Selection**: Choose which stocks to trade
- **Risk Parameters**: Adjust position sizes, stop losses
