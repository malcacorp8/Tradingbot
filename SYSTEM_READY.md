## 🧠 **Understanding Your AI Agents**

Each stock (AAPL, TSLA, GOOGL, MSFT, NVDA) has its own AI agent that:

### **Learning Process**
1. **Observes** market data (price, volume, trends)
2. **Decides** action based on Q-table (buy/sell/hold)
3. **Executes** trade through Alpaca API
4. **Learns** from reward/punishment
5. **Updates** strategy for next decision

### **Key Metrics to Watch**
- **Balance**: Current cash position
- **Total Return**: Performance vs starting capital
- **Win Rate**: Percentage of profitable trades
- **Exploration Rate**: How much agent is experimenting
- **Q-Table Size**: Number of learned states

### **Expected Learning Curve**
- **First Hour**: Random exploration (losses expected)
- **First Day**: Pattern recognition begins
- **First Week**: Strategy development
- **Long Term**: Sophisticated autonomous trading

## 📊 **Real-time Monitoring**

### **Advanced Dashboard Features**
- **Live Agent Status**: See each agent's current state
- **Reward Charts**: Visual learning progress
- **Trading Activity Feed**: Real-time decision log
- **Exploration Progress**: Watch agents get smarter
- **Performance Metrics**: Returns, trades, win rates

### **Understanding the Interface**
- **Green bars**: Positive rewards (good decisions)
- **Red bars**: Negative rewards (learning opportunities)
- **Exploration %**: Higher = more experimenting
- **Q-States**: Number of market situations learned

## 🎮 **Advanced Controls**

### **Start AI Trading**
```bash
# Via Dashboard UI (Recommended)
http://localhost:8000/advanced → "Start AI Trading"
